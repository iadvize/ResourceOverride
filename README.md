# Resource Override

## !!! Development on RO has stopped indefinitely !!!

If you still need to override stuff - see how chrome can override content natively: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxjGYcHZ_uI

You can try to use my half baked [MV3 branch here](https://github.com/kylepaulsen/ResourceOverride/tree/mv3), but it is untested and I won't be supporting it.

I don't plan to work on RO anymore so it's very unlikly this will ever be
finished. I'm not the biggest fan of what MV3 is forcing upon
people, so I don't have very much motivation to finish this.
Additionally, most modern web development doesn't really need/work
with an extension like this, and even if there are use cases,
Chrome supports overriding content natively within their debug
tools: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxjGYcHZ_uI

Anyway, I apologize if this is disappointing news. You are welcome
to build the extension yourself or use the source code in other
ways, as it is under the MIT license. Maybe someday I will really
wish I finished this and have a bad need for it - but until that
day, this will be my last commit.

Thanks everyone for using RO.

I wish you the best.

### Old Readme text:

Resource Override is an extension to help you gain full control of any website by redirecting traffic, replacing, editing, or inserting new content.

[Get the chrome extension here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/resource-override/pkoacgokdfckfpndoffpifphamojphii).

### Now on firefox!
[Get the FireFox extension here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/resourceoverride/)

### How to install
In the extensions page you just have to click on "load unpacked extension" (when you've activated developer mode at the top right of the page), select the cloned folder and you're done

Otherwise you can clone the repo, pack it and provide the packaged extension directly in the extension section.
